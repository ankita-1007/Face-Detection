<h2>1. Description </h2>
This project can be used for: <br>
<br>
1. Detect faces from live images taken from webcam. <br>
2. Detct faces in short live video sequence.<br>
3. Detect faces in mask wearing images. <br>

<h2>2. Background:  </h2>
<b>Face detection </b>is a computer vision problem that involves finding faces in photos.State-of-the-art face detection can be achieved using a Multi-task Cascade CNN via the <b>MTCNN</b> library.
Locating a face in a photograph refers to finding the coordinate of the face in the image, whereas localization refers to demarcating the extent of the face, often via a bounding box around the face.
Detected faces can then be provided as input to a subsequent system, such as a face recognition system.
Face detection is a necessary first-step in <b>face recognition systems</b>, with the purpose of localizing and extracting the face region from the background.
A number of deep learning methods have been developed and demonstrated for face detection.<br>
<br>
One of the more popular approaches is called the <b>“Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network,”</b> or MTCNN . <br>
<br> 


During the COVID-19 pandemic, face detection systems have become crucial as they can effectively detect faces even when individuals are wearing masks, 
enabling reliable identification and surveillance in public settings.

<h2>3. Use cases:  </h2>
Face detection has numerous practical applications across various industries. Some key use cases include: <br>

1. <b>Security and surveillance</b>: Face detection systems are used in video surveillance to identify and track individuals of interest, enhancing security in public spaces, airports, and other high-security areas.<br>

2. <b>Biometric identification</b>: Face detection is widely used in biometric systems for identity verification and access control, such as unlocking smartphones or granting access to secure facilities.<br>

3. <b>Emotion recognition</b>: By analyzing facial expressions, face detection can be used to infer emotions, enabling applications in market research, customer sentiment analysis, and improving human-computer interaction. <br>
